The shader compiler sucks at paths with spaces in them, so I recommend exporting your
devtools, dx9sdk, materialsystem, and sdkshaders folders to a location with no spaces.
Then run build_dhl_shaders.bat from there and you're set.  I also recommend writing a little
batch script to pause at the end of compiling.
