# Distraction Half-Life 2
A Source engine mod in the style of Action Half-Life, The Opera, and The Specialists. Written very gradually ~2005-2010.

## Building
Project files are included in game/server and game/client for Visual Studio 2005 & 2008. This was last updated in 2010 so it is based on the 2009 release of the Source SDK.  It will almost certainly not work with the current 2013 SDK without significant restructuring.

## License
Distributed in accordance with Valve's terms for the SDK.  See [license file](LICENSE).
